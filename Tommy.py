    football+="Hi babe!" 
    football+="I have something for you." 
    football+="Just a little something." 
    football+="Sure, it's yours" 
    football+="Wow, you look so sexy, Lisa." 
    football+="I would do anything for my girl." 
    football+="Oh hi, Denny." 
    football+="Anything for my princess! Ha-ha-ha-ha." 
    football+="Nice to see you, Denny. I'm going to take a nap." 
    football+="Ha-ha!" 
    football+="A-ha-ha" 
    football+="You always think. A-ha-ha. Alright, I'm ready" 
    football+="Oh, yeahhh." 
    football+="A-ha-ha! dsajfkjasdg Ha-ha-ha! Ouch!" 
    football+="Denny, do you have something else to do?" 
    football+="Denny, two's great, but three's a crowd, ha-ha." 
    football+="That's the idea!" 
    football+="Bye, Denny." 
    football+="Did you like last night?" 
    football+="Ha-ha-ha." 
    football+="Unh-unh. I have to go now." 
    football+="Bye." 
    football+="Hi."

    football+="Here you go, keep the change. Hi doggy!" 
    football+="Thanks a lot, bye!" 
    football+="Hi babe. These are for you." 
    football+="Nah." 
    football+="That son of a bitch told me that I would get it within three months. I save them bundles. They’re crazy. I don’t think I will ever get it. They betray me, they didn’t keep their promise, they tricked me, and I don’t care anymore."
    football+="Of course, what do you think? They already put my ideas into practice. The bank saves money, and they are using me, and I am the fool."
    football+="You're the only one who does" 
    football+="Whatever, I don't care." 
    football+="You think about everything, ha-ha." 
    football+="I don't drink, you know that!"

    football+="Unhh..." 
    football+="I love you, Lisa" 
    football+="Let's take him to the police." 
    football+="Are you okay, Denny?" 
    football+="Are you okay?" 
    football+="Let's go home." 
    football+="Why did you do this? you know better, right? Why?!" 
    football+="You know better, Denny, you almost got killed." 
    football+="Let's go home." 
    football+="I did not hit her! It’s not true! It’s bullshit! I did not hit her! I did not! (he throws a water bottle to the floor) Oh, hi Mark." 
    football+="I have a problem with Lisa. She says that I hit her." 
    football+="No, it's not true! Don't even ask! What's new with you?" 
    football+="Yeah. " 
    football+=" Whats makes you say that? " 
    football+="I don't have to worry about that because Lisa is loyal to me. " 
    football+="A-ha-ha-ha-ha! What a story, Mark! " 
    football+="I'm so happy I have you as my best friend, and I love Lisa so much. " 
    football+="Well maybe you should have a girl, Mark. " 
    football+="Well, what happened? Remember Better? That's her name? " 
    football+="Yeah. " 
    football+="That's too bad. My Lisa is great when I can get it. " 
    football+="It seems to me like you're the expert, Mark! " 
    football+="What's bothering you, Mark? " 
    football+="Do you, do you have some secrets? Why don't you tell me? " 
    football+="Well, whatever. " 
    football+="Oh hi, Denny. " 
    football+="He's cranky today. A-ha-ha-ha. Girl trouble. What's new with you?" 
    football+="Sure, we are. " 
    football+="Well we'll see... Denny, don't plan too much. It may not come outright. " 
    football+="Okay. " 
    football+="Shoot, Denny. " 
    football+="Go on. " 
    football+="Denny, don’t worry about that. Lisa loves you too. As a person, as a human being, as a friend. You know people don’t have to say it. They can feel it. " 
    football+="You can love someone deep inside your heart, and there is nothing wrong with it. If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live. " 
    football+="Denny, don’t worry about it. You are part of our family, and we love you very much. And we will help you anytime. And Lisa loves you too. As a friend. You are sort of like her son. " 
    football+="No, because I trust you and I trust Lisa. What about Elizabeth, hunh? " 
    football+="M-hm. " 
    football+="That's the idea. " 
    football+="You're very welcome, Denny, and keep in mind, if you have any problems, talk to me, and I will help you. " 
    football+="Let's go eat, hunh? Come on, let's go. Let's go. I'm starving. " 
    football+="Hello Michelle. I heard you. What secret?" 
    football+="Did you get a new dress?" 
    football+="What's she talking about?" 
    football+="I never hit you. You shouldn't have any secrets from me. I'm your future husband. " 
    football+="Don't talk like that. What do you mean? " 
    football+="A-ha-ha-ha. You must be kidding, aren't you? " 
    football+="How dare you talk to me like that! You should tell me everything! " 
    football+="Why Lisa, why Lisa, please talk to me, please! You're part of my life, you are everything, I could not go on without you Lisa." 
    football+="You're lying, I never hit you." 
    # HERE IT IS
    football+="You are tearing me apart, Lisa!" 
    football+="Do you understand life? Do you?" 
    football+="You drive me crazy. " 
    football+="Don't worry about it. I still love you. Goodnight, Lisa. " 
    football+="Oh hi, Mike, what's new? " 
    football+="A-ha-ha. " 
    football+="Go on, I'm listening. " 
    football+="You must be kidding. Underwear, I got the picture. " 
    football+="That's life. " 
    football+="Yeah. " 
    football+="Oh hey, Denny. " 
    football+="Come on, it's good for you, come on. " 
    football+="Let's go for it. " 
    football+="He doesn't. " 
    football+="Hi Mark. " 
    football+="Mark, why don't you take him home? And Mike, listen, if you need anything, call me anytime, alright? Are you alright? " 
    football+="Let's go home, Denny. " 
    football+="How can they say this about me? I don’t believe it. I show them. I will record everything." 
    football+="I don't understand women. Do you, Peter?" 
    football+="They never say what they mean, and they always play games. " 
    football+="I have a serious problem with Lisa. Um, I don't think she's faithful to me. In fact, I know she isn't. " 
    football+="Yeah I’m sure, I overheard a conversation between Lisa and her mother. What should I do, Peter? " 
    football+="Yeah. " 
    football+="But you're a psychologist. Do you have some advice? " 
    football+="I can’t confront her! I want to give her a second chance, after all, she’s my future wife. You know what they say: “love is blind.” " 
    football+="We're just talking about women. " 
    football+="Can I meet her? " 
    football+="You mean she's too old, or you think I will take her away from you? Hunh? " 
    football+="I have some own problems. " 
    football+="Peter, you always play psychologist with us! " 
    football+="List is teasing me about whether we are going to get married or not. And we didn't make love in a while. And I don't know what to do." 
    football+="Not Always! " 
    football+="You're right, Peter. Ha-ha. Is she getting a divorce, Mark? " 
    football+="I am, sure. " 
    football+="Ha-ha-ha, chicken, Peter, you're just a little chicken! Cheep, cheep cheep cheep cheep chee-ee-ee-eep eeeeeeeeeee! "
    football+="sdfwefw I don't mind. Mark, do you remember the one with big tits, the blondie one? " 
    football+="Ha-ha yeah, “can you marry me?”, ha-ha, I thought I would take her up on it, ha-ha. " 
    football+="Yeah, the barbecue chicken was delicious, rice, that was cool. " 
    football+="No we can't. I expect Lisa any minute. " 
    football+="Well that's a very interesting story, when I moved to San Francisco with two suitcases and I didn't know anyone and I have, uh, I head to YMCA with a $2000 check which I could not check. " 
    football+="Well because it was an out of state bank. Anyway, uh, I was working as a busboy in a hotel, and uh, uh, she was sitting, drinking her coffee, and she was so beautiful, and I say hi to her. That’s how we met. " 
    football+="Well the interesting part is that on our first date, she paid for dinner. " 
    football+="Whatever. Do you guys want to eat something? " 
    football+="Oh, thank you. Yeah, thanks a lot. " 
    football+="Oh, hi Denny. Nice tux, you look great. " 
    football+="A-ha-ha. " 
    football+="Oh, thanks. "

    football+="Wowwwwwww. " 
    football+="You look great. You look a babyface. " 
    football+="A-ha. "

    football+="Oh hi, Susan." 
    football+="Hot chocolate, please. " 
    football+="Medium. " 
    football+="What happened now, Mark? " 
    football+="What makes you say that? " 
    football+="Well, you should be happy, Mark. " 
    football+="Oh, thank you so much. " 
    football+="Nah. " 
    football+="Oh, pretty good. We got a new client at the bank, we make a lot of money. " 
    football+="I cannot tell you, it's confidential. " 
    football+="No I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life? " 
    football+="Why not? " 
    football+="Oh god, I have to run. "
